# Pushed guardrail wiring commit to origin/main

**What**: Pushed commit `227883ad` (feat(guard): wire delegateWithGuardrail into production delegation paths) to origin/main. All pre-push hooks passed (audit-check, ci-static-gates, container-scan exit 0 with image-size allowlisted, content-validate 21/21, coverage-gate 28/28, lint, orchestrator-auto-fix, perf-baseline PASS, shell-quoting, typecheck).

**Why**: User requested push + continue with pending items.

**Where**: origin/main (b0dff835..227883ad)

**Learned**: 
- Stack verified green: watchtower 97 PASS / 0 FAIL after running `npm run process:reap` to clean a stale pidfile (monitor-daemon.pid PID 39768).
- Only remaining WARN is model `qwen2.5-coder-7b-instruct` unhealthy in health registry (local ollama model, not blocking; active model is opencode-go/gpt-5.6-luna).
- Incident log `.session/guardrails/incidents.jsonl` has 3 real incidents recorded from delegation tests.
- Next: evaluate more pipeline points (session-close, saga, rollback) for item 3 guardrail integration.
