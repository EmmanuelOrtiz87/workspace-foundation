# Full test stack fix — 490/0 PASS, commit complete

**What**: Audited and fixed entire Gentle-Vanguard test stack — 20+ test files migrated to Pester v5 syntax, broken paths corrected, missing stubs created

**Why**: Tests had 382 failures from Pester v5 incompatibility (file-level vars in BeforeAll), broken paths from scripts/utilities reorganization, missing stub scripts

**Where**: 48 files across tests/, scripts/utilities/, plugins/, tools/
- tests/unit/, tests/security/, tests/integration/, tests/performance/ — BeforeAll migration + fixed paths
- scripts/utilities/SKILLS-TOOLS/plugin-loader.ps1 — $null = Register-Plugin (output leak fix)
- scripts/utilities/WORKFLOW-ORCHESTRATION/pre-process-input.ps1 — Added Mandatory param
- scripts/utilities/AGENT/agent-verify.ps1 — Migrated -Path to New-PesterConfiguration
- scripts/utilities/pre-process-input.ps1 — Canonical keyword-routing impl (CREATED)
- scripts/utilities/session-autostart.cmd — CMD shim (CREATED)
- tools/session-autostart.cmd — CMD shim (CREATED)
- plugins/example-hello-world/ — Plugin example (CREATED)
- scripts/utilities/GUARD/pre-close-validator.ps1 — Stub (CREATED)
- scripts/utilities/PROMPT/semantic-compression.ps1 — Stub (CREATED)

**Learned**: 
- Pester v5 rejects file-level $PSScriptRoot — MUST use BeforeAll {}
- Register-Plugin leaks hashtable output — wrap with $null =
- session-autostart.cmd was 85+ references but never existed — created CMD shims
- Pester -Path parameter triggers Legacy v4 compat warning — use New-PesterConfiguration
- Commit 1514aa95 — all 17/17 hooks passed (json-lint, opencode-validation, trufflehog-scan, workflow-lint, commitlint, codegraph-sync, hashline-snapshot)
- Final verification: 490 PASS / 0 FAIL / 0 Skipped / 0 NotRun
