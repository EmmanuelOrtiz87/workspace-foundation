# Session Complete: GGA System Implementation Committed

**What**: Session completed - GGA (Guardian Angel) AI Provider Switcher system fully implemented, tested, documented, and committed to repository

- src/agent-delegator.ts - Enhanced with model support (committed)
- package.json - New gga:* scripts (committed)

**Learned**:
- commit hash: acd41af0
- TypeScript compiles without errors
- All hooks passed (json-lint, opencode-validation, secretlint, trufflehog)
- Use shell:true for Windows spawn with npx commands
