# Full stack audit 2026-08-26: 96/98 PASS, stack healthy

**What**: Complete stack audit of Gentle-Vanguard v3.8.2 — 12 verification checks executed directly by orchestrator (subagents failed due to gpt-5.6-luna model having no credits).

**Why**: User requested full stack review to ensure everything is correct, connected, functional, and real. Subagent delegation failed because opencode.json model config doesn't control the task tool's model resolution.

**Where**: Entire stack — src/, apps/web-dashboard/, config/, .runtime/, .engram-data/, graphify-out/

**Results**:
- TypeScript typecheck: PASS (0 errors)
- ESLint: PASS (0 violations)
- Watchtower: 96/98 PASS, 2 WARN (unrelated model providers)
- Nexus DB: HEALTHY (27 tables, 57,908 rows, 15 migrations)
- Dashboard build: SUCCESS (13.89s, 2036 modules)
- Graphify: ACTIVE (3.3MB graph)
- Token budget: 35% daily, 1% session
- Secret scan: 25 matches (all in tests/examples, no real secrets)
- Format: ~80 files need prettier formatting (cosmetic)

**Learned**: 
1. opencode.json model config does NOT control the task tool's subagent model — this is a platform limitation
2. For reliable execution, orchestrator should run checks directly via bash instead of delegating to subagents
3. stack:verify:quick crashes with ChildProcess.kill error on Windows — needs investigation
4. deps:check:quiet times out at 60s — may need longer timeout or optimization
5. The 2 WARN in watchtower are for external model providers (Gemini, Qwen) that are intentionally not configured
