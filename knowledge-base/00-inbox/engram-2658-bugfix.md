# Migrated to moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 - Requires final restart

**FINAL UPDATE - Migration to opencode-recognized model**

## Problem
- Error: "Model not found: inherit-from-session/." persisted
- Root cause: opencode internal mechanism generates "inherit-from-session" when it doesn't recognize the model
- Despite all configurations being correct, opencode couldn't resolve kimi-2-5 from littellmott provider

## Solution Applied
Changed both configs to use `moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` instead of `kimi-2-5`:
- ✅ ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json → "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5"
- ✅ ./opencode.json → "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5"

## Why this works
- moonshotai/kimi-k2.5 IS in opencode's model cache (~/.cache/opencode/models.json)
- Verified in cache output: "moonshotai/kimi-k2.5" exists with full metadata
- This is a recognized provider/model combination

## Files Modified
1. ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json (global config)
2. ./opencode.json (project config)
3. config/model-health-registry.json (health monitoring)
4. src/smart-model-router.ts (router)
5. src/model-error-interceptor.ts (error handling)
6. src/smart-task-wrapper.ts (task wrapper)

## Next Step
CLOSE and RESTART opencode/claude completely for changes to take effect.

## Expected Result After Restart
- task() calls should work without "Model not found" errors
- Subagents should inherit model correctly
- Smart fallback system should be ready for activation
