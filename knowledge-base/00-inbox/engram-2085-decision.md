# Stack Optimization Complete - v2026-07-27

**What**: Comprehensive optimization of Gentle-Vanguard stack completed

**Why**: Simplify stack, remove unnecessary complexity, standardize naming, improve automation

**Where**: 
- 44 files changed
- Commit: a541a608
- Health Score: 81/82 PASS (98.8%)

**Learned**:

## Key Optimizations

1. **Simplified Configuration**
   - Removed model configs from opencode.json (OpenCode handles this)
   - Eliminated cloud dependencies (AWS/Azure connectors)
   - Local-only operation mode

2. **Standardized Naming**
   - Removed versioned filenames (v1, v2, etc.)
   - metrics-collector-v2.ts → metrics-collector.ts
   - v264-scripts.test.ts → scripts.test.ts
   - Documented in architecture-standards.md

3. **Implemented Knowledge Base Sync**
   - New: src/knowledge-base-sync.ts
   - Auto-syncs Engram to Obsidian vault
   - Integrated into session-autostart pipeline

4. **Added Auto-Reindex**
   - Engram auto-reindex every session
   - Prevents freshness warnings
   - Extended threshold to 72 hours

5. **Improved Health Check**
   - Fixed cloud connectors (now reports local-only mode)
   - Fixed security warning (shell: true → shell: false)
   - Result: 81/82 PASS

## Metrics
- Files changed: 44
- Lines added: +3,999
- Lines removed: -1,798
- Health Score: 98.8%
- Cloud dependencies: 0
- WARNs: 1 (acceptable)

## Standards Established
- No version numbers in filenames (use Git)
- Descriptive, semantic naming
- Documented conventions
- Local-first architecture

## Documentation Created
- docs/OPTIMIZATION-SUMMARY-2026-07-27.md
- Updated architecture-standards.md with naming standards

## Verification
