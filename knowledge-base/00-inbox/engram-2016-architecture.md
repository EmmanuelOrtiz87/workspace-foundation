# Final stack completion: post-mortem, tokens, SEA builder, all fixes pushed

**What**: Final batch of tools completed: post-mortem trigger, design token pipeline, Node SEA builder. Registered all in pipeline config, skill-router, and package.json. Pushed commit 4163e37c.
**Why**: Close the remaining gaps to make the full stack 100% operational with native TypeScript tooling.
**Where**:
  - src/post-mortem-trigger.ts — post-auto-heal automation with self-diagnosis, Nexus DB, audit log, incidents
  - src/design-token-pipeline.ts — config/brand.json → assets/tokens.css + tokens.json + tokens.scss + SVG regeneration
  - src/build-sea.ts — Node.js SEA compiler (replaces PS2EXE) for standalone .exe builds
  - config/session-autostart.config.json — 2 new lazy steps (post-mortem-trigger, design-token-pipeline)
  - src/skills/skill-router.ts — +10 keywords for post-mortem, incidents, design tokens
  - package.json — +3 scripts (gv:postmortem, gv:tokens, gv:sea)
  - src/semantic-search.ts — fix: rg stdio:ignore (cross-platform)
  - src/performance-slo-monitor.ts — fix: wmic → Get-PSDrive (Win10/11)
**Commit**: 4163e37c on develop — "feat: post-mortem trigger, design token pipeline, SEA builder, pipeline config, skill-router keywords, fixes"
**Learned**: Node SEA requires Node >= 20.11.0 and postject npm package for full .exe injection. The blob generation works but postject is needed for the final step. All 3 new files pass typecheck + lint.
