# Archify app enhanced — complete all 3 frontend files + fix 17 type errors

**What**: Wrote 3 remaining frontend files (api.ts, App.tsx, styles.css) and fixed 17 TypeScript compilation errors across server and frontend files.

**Why**: Archify app needed visual canvas editor, AI generation, import, config, and library views. The previous session had created server-side modules but left the frontend incomplete.

**Where**: apps/archify/src/api.ts (new), apps/archify/src/App.tsx (rewritten), apps/archify/src/styles.css (rewritten), apps/archify/server/shared-types.ts (new), apps/archify/server/server.ts (fixed), apps/archify/server/ai-generate.ts (fixed), apps/archify/server/importers.ts (fixed), apps/archify/src/components/CanvasEditor.tsx (fixed)

**Learned**: 
- Server modules can't import from `../../src/api` (different compilation context) — created `server/shared-types.ts` with shared `DiagramType`
- `server/server.ts` had leftover Nexus DB code (`DatabaseManager.getInstance().events.insertEvent(DEFAULT_TENANT_ID, ...)`) that conflicted with the new app-local DB — removed duplicate `trackEvent` function, renamed import to `dbTrackEvent`
- CanvasEditor.tsx used `e.sourceNode?.data` / `e.targetNode?.data` but React Flow edge objects don't have `sourceNode`/`targetNode` — fixed by building a nodeMap lookup and using `resolveId(e.source)` / `resolveId(e.target)`
- `APP_DB_PATH` was used in server.ts but never imported — added to db.ts import line
- Typecheck (`npx tsc --noEmit`) now passes clean with 0 errors
- The Archify app now has 6 views: Studio, Canvas (React Flow), AI Generate, Delta/PR, Library, Config
- Import supports: Draw.io XML, Excalidraw JSON, Mermaid text
- All API endpoints: health, examples, render, validate, delta, import, ai/generate, config (GET/POST), llm/status, diagrams CRUD
