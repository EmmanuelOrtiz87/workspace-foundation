# v7.0 mesh API + v7.2 engram integration committed and pushed

**What**: Implemented and pushed v7.0 Multi-repo Mesh API + v7.2 Engram Integration. Commit acb1429. 7 files changed, 335 insertions, 100 deletions. Push successful to origin/develop. Build verified: 0 TS errors, 2198 modules, ~2.8s.

**Why**: Close remaining roadmap items: mesh REST endpoints for cross-workspace MCP orchestration + connect knowledge-query to mem_search CLI.

**Where**: 
- new: apps/web-dashboard/server/mesh-api.ts (3 handlers: GET /api/mesh, POST discover, POST sync)
- modified: apps/web-dashboard/server/websocket-server.ts (3 new routes)
- modified: apps/web-dashboard/src/components/MultiRepoView.tsx (rewritten for real mesh data, Discover/Sync/Refresh buttons)
- modified: scripts/utilities/knowledge/knowledge-query.ps1 (mem_search CLI as primary engram source, 3 fallback levels)
- modified: VERSION (7.0.0), CHANGELOG.md, docs/ROADMAP.md

**Learned**: The TS6133 error (unused import) is caught at build time. Always verify unused imports after creating new server files. Pre-push hooks (audit-check, orchestrator-auto-fix) passed with 0 issues.
