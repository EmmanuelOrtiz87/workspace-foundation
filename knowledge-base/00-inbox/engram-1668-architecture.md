# Stack fully verified — all systems green

**What**: Full stack verification after 3 commits — all systems operational, nothing pending

**Why**: User requested continued evolution; confirmed no remaining work

**Where**: Entire Gentle-Vanguard v8.0.1

**Learned**: 
- TypeScript: 0 errors (20 TS files in src/)
- Watchtower: 78/78 PASS, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL
- Eval tests: 80/80 PASS (5 quality gate suites)
- Config tests: 21/21 PASS
- Git commits: b9fd7d1f, 2ceb21d4, 9bc132eb (all hooks passing)
- Runtime state files (.codex, .windsurf, .engram checksums, gateguard) change every session — not commit-worthy
- No pending code changes, no broken references, no TODO items in codebase
- Session autostart takes >3min (53 lazy pipeline steps) — runs in background
- Dashboard builds clean in ~3s
