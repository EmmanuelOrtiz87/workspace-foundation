# Implemented 4 roadmap features for v3.2.0

**What**: Implemented 4 roadmap features from the presentation: Community Skills, Global Health Dashboard, CI/CD Expansion, Auto-Update

**Where**: 
- Community Skills: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill-contribution.yml`, `.github/workflows/community-skill-review.yml`, `apps/web-dashboard/server/marketplace-api.ts` (real directory scanning), `apps/web-dashboard/server/marketplace-server-routes.ts`, `scripts/utilities/SKILLS-TOOLS/submit-community-skill.ps1`, `apps/web-dashboard/src/components/Marketplace.tsx` (real API integration)
- Global Health Dashboard: `apps/web-dashboard/src/types/dashboard.ts` (GlobalHealth/RepositoryHealth types), `apps/web-dashboard/src/components/GlobalHealth.tsx`, `apps/web-dashboard/server/global-health-api.ts`, `apps/web-dashboard/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` (GlobalHealth integration), `apps/web-dashboard/server/websocket-server.ts` (health endpoint), `apps/web-dashboard/src/hooks/useMetrics.ts` (globalHealth handling)
- CI/CD Expansion: Root `Dockerfile`, `apps/web-dashboard/Dockerfile`, `apps/web-dashboard/nginx.conf`, `.github/workflows/docker-validate.yml`, `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`, `tests/integration/api-health.test.ts`, enhanced `docker-compose.test.yml`
- Auto-Update: `scripts/utilities/check-version.ps1`, `scripts/utilities/auto-update.ps1`, updated `gentle-vanguard.ps1` (version from VERSION file, -Update/-CheckVersion flags), `.github/workflows/auto-update.yml`, `releases/latest-version.json`

**Learned**: 
- Marketplace API now scans real skills/ directory instead of mock data
- gentile-vanguard.ps1 reads version dynamically from VERSION file
- All 4 features are independent and were implementable in parallel
- 17+ files created/modified total
