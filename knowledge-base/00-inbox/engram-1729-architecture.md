# Wave 7 PS1→TS migrations completed — 12 total migrations, all clean

**What**: Completed Wave 7 of PS1→TypeScript migrations (4 new files) plus dashboard build fix
**Why**: Finalize all prioritised PS1→TS migrations to eliminate PowerShell dependencies and CMD popup windows
**Where**: 
- src/session-metrics-tracker.ts (session metrics tracking, tested start/status/end)
- src/validate-tool-configs.ts (multi-tool JSON schema validator, ALL PASS)
- src/adaptive-opencode-profile.ts (inline helpers from adaptive-common.ps1)
- apps/web-dashboard/server/websocket-server.ts (moved headers const outside try block for catch scope)
- config/session-autostart.config.json (session-metrics-start → TS)
- config/ps1-ts-migration.json v7.0.0 (completedWave7, nextWave empty)
**Learned**: 
- ESM files must use `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href` for direct-run detection
- `const` in try block is NOT accessible in catch block — must lift to function scope
- windowsHide: true required in spawn() calls to prevent CMD popups on Windows
- 12 PS1→TS migrations completed across all waves, 32 TS files in src/
- nextWave is now empty — no high-priority PS1 migrations remain
