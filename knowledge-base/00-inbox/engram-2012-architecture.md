# Full tool stack completion: semantic search, images, diagrams, SLO, CI gates

**What**: Completed the full Gentle-Vanguard tool stack with 6 new TS tools, 2 new skills, CI SRE gates, and integrity manifest regeneration.
**Why**: Close all remaining gaps to have 100% native TypeScript tooling for design, development, monitoring, and quality.
**Where**: 
  - src/performance-slo-monitor.ts — real-time SLO monitoring (disk <80%, memory <512MB, latency <500ms) with Nexus DB persistence + CI gate
  - src/cli/image-gen.ts — multi-provider AI image generation (DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, FLUX, SVG fallback) with batch mode
  - src/cli/diagram-renderer.ts — Graphviz DOT + PlantUML renderer with auto-detection, viz.js fallback, watch mode, CodeGraph integration
  - src/semantic-search.ts — natural-language code search via CodeGraph + ripgrep fallback
  - src/workload-guard.ts — prevents changes >400 lines or >8 files, --git-diff mode
  - src/self-diagnosis.ts — Break Glass diagnosis with 3 states, automatic profile suggestions
  - skills/image-generation-skill/SKILL.md — skill with all provider docs
  - skills/diagram-renderer-skill/SKILL.md — skill with DOT/PUML examples, CodeGraph integration
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml — new `sre-checks` job with error-budget + perf:slo --ci-gate
  - package.json — 8 new npm scripts
  - src/skills/skill-router.ts — 28 new keywords
  - build/public/manifest.json — regenerated (295 files)
**Commit**: 5950a3a5 on develop — "feat: semantic-search, image-gen, diagram-renderer, workload-guard, self-diagnosis, perf-slo, CI SRE gates"
**Learned**: git tracks src/Skills/skill-router.ts with capital S (case-insensitive on Windows). gv:protect encrypts 295 files. pre-push orchestrator-auto-fix validates docs, skills, TS, Docker, security. trufflehog-scan shows usage but does not block commits. CRLF warnings on Windows are normal.
