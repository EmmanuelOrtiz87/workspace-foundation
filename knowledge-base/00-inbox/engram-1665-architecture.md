# Stack fully stable — all systems green

**What**: Complete stack verification — all systems operational with 0 warnings, 0 failures

**Why**: User requested full stack verification after PS1→TS Wave 5 + tracing fixes

**Where**: Entire Gentle-Vanguard v8.0.1 stack

**Learned**: 
- Watchtower: 78/78 PASS, 0 WARN, 0 FAIL
- TypeScript: 0 errors (20 TS files in src/)
- Eval tests: 80/80 PASS (5 quality gate suites)
- Config tests: 21/21 PASS
- Dashboard: builds clean (3.32s)
- Git hooks: all passing (13 pre-commit, 2 commit-msg, 2 post-commit)
- Session autostart: takes >3min with 53 pipeline steps (all lazy/async)
- Remaining runtime state files (.codex, .windsurf, .engram checksums) are generated during operation
- PS1 scripts dashboard-ws-autostart and engram-rag-reindex improved with duplicate detection and freshness logging
