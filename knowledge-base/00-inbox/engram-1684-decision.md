# Session complete: 7 commits, all stack fixes resolved, system 100% operational

**What**: Completed all pending stack fixes across 7 commits on branch cleanup/phase1-remove-unreferenced-scripts

**Why**: User requested full resolution of all pending work with maximum precision, efficiency, and stack optimization

**Where**: src/engram-auto-sync.ts, scripts/utilities/config/validate-opencode-config.ps1, scripts/utilities/EVOLVE/auto-code-review.ps1, .codex/config.toml, .windsurf/config.json, .engram/checksums.sha256, .engram-data/, .runtime/telemetry/

**Learned**: 
- Always guard syncChecksums() against missing DB (same pattern as checkSynchronization())
- OpenCode 'references' (plural) is valid property, not typo of 'reference'
- CodeGraph WAL checkpoint (sqlite3 PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)) resolved DEGRADED→HEALTHY
- auto-code-review.ps1 needs Test-Path guard before Get-Content for staged deletions
- Prettier pre-commit check catches formatting before commit — always run on modified files
- Session pipeline 30/30 steps, 0 failures across all sessions
