# PS1→TS Wave 5 migration complete

**What**: Migrated 3 PS1 scripts to TypeScript (Wave 5): post-autostart-summary.ts, engram-auto-sync.ts, skill-recommender.ts

**Why**: Continuing PS1→TS migration to reduce Windows dependency, unify codebase in TypeScript, improve type safety

**Where**: src/post-autostart-summary.ts (56→~95 lines), src/engram-auto-sync.ts (203→~160 lines), src/skill-recommender.ts (155→~195 lines), config/session-autostart.config.json (5 entries updated), config/ps1-ts-migration.json (wave5 added)

**Learned**: 
- engram-auto-sync.ts: file-locking maps to lock file age check + unlinkSync in finally block; setInterval replaces Start-Sleep loop
- skill-recommender.ts: tokenization + branch-hint regex translated directly; getContextKeywords was unused and removed
- post-autostart-summary.ts: uses child_process.execSync for git commands
- All 3 had unused imports caught by TS6133 strict mode; engram-auto-sync had shell:true type mismatch (TS2769)
- Typecheck now clean (0 errors), 80/80 eval tests PASS, 21/21 config tests PASS
- Total TS files in src/: 20 (including dashboard/)
