# Gentle-Vanguard Code Review + Gentle AI Alignment

**What**: Completed comprehensive code review of Gentle-Vanguard stack and aligned with Gentle AI official methodology

**Why**: Validate our judgment process against official Gentle AI sources and implement missing features

**Where**: 
- src/rollback-orchestrator.ts (lint fixes)
- src/snapshot-manager.ts (lint fixes)
- scripts/utilities/ops/REVIEW/receipt-manager.ts (NEW)
- scripts/utilities/ops/REVIEW/staged-review.ts (NEW)
- .opencode/skills/code-review-and-quality/references/review-process.md (updated)
- .opencode/skills/code-review-and-quality/references/review-authority-threat-model.md (NEW)
- docs/reference/GENTLE-AI-ALIGNMENT-PROPOSAL.md (NEW)

**Learned**:
- Our 5-axis review (Correctness, Readability, Architecture, Security, Performance) is aligned with Gentle AI
- Missing: receipt binding, staged index review, threat model documentation
- Implemented both receipt-manager.ts and staged-review.ts to close the gaps
- Fixed 6 lint errors in rollback-orchestrator.ts and snapshot-manager.ts
- Fixed 9 lint errors + 6 typecheck errors in new REVIEW scripts
