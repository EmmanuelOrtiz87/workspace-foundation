# Live Traceability Dashboard - Complete Implementation

**What**: Complete live traceability system for the metrics dashboard. Added real-time session tracing with per-turn token/cost/context tracking, mechanism change detection from agent profiles, and historical aggregation.

**Why**: Needed to provide live visibility into agent behavior - token consumption per turn, profile/mechanism changes with reasons, and historical session review with filtering.

**Where**: 
- reports/dashboard-v2/server.js - 7 API endpoints reading real data from .session/context-log/
- reports/dashboard-v2/app.js - trace section with turns table, mechanism timeline, history filters, charts
- reports/dashboard-v2/index.html - traceability UI container
- reports/dashboard-v2/styles.css - ~200 lines of traceability styles
- reports/dashboard-v2/i18n.js - trace nav/section translations
- .opencode/skills/live-traceability/SKILL.md - skill definition for future sessions
- .session/context-log/ - real session data (4 sessions, 21 turns total)

**Learned**: 
- The mechanism detection needs config/model-routing.json agents to map model types to profiles
- context-log entries from turn-001.md contain full input/output summaries while .state.json has numeric metrics only
- Start-Job in PowerShell doesn't reliably persist for long-running servers; Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden works
- All 13 existing dashboard tests continue to pass after the changes
