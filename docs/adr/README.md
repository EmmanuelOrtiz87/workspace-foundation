# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Purpose**: Document significant architectural decisions and their rationales  
**Format**: [Lightweight ADR Format](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record)  
**Review
Cycle**: Annually or when circumstances change

---

## Overview

ADRs provide:

- **Rationale**: Why we chose this approach (not just what we did)
- **Alternatives**: What we considered and rejected
- **Consequences**: Tradeoffs and mitigation strategies
- **Context**: Historical record for future maintainers

Each ADR is immutable once accepted. Updates create new ADRs (ADR-0011, etc).

## How to Read ADRs

**Quick Overview** (5 min):

1. Read "Status" line
2. Read "Decision" section
3. Scan "Consequences" for pros/cons

**Full Understanding** (15 min):

1. Understand "Context" and problem
2. Review "Alternatives Considered" table
3. Study "Implementation Details"
4. Note "Related Decisions"

**Challenging a Decision** (30 min):

1. Read the full ADR including "Rationale"
2. Review "Consequences" and "Mitigation"
3. Check "References" for supporting material
4. Open GitHub discussion if you disagree

---

## Creating New ADRs

**When to create an ADR:**

- Major architectural choice (not minor implementation details)
- Decision affects multiple teams or long-term
- Choice has tradeoffs worth documenting
- Team might revisit this decision in future

**When NOT to create an ADR:**

- Bug fixes or patches
- Refactoring internal implementation
- Minor configuration changes
- One-off experimental features

**Process:**

1. **Draft** in [DRAFT template](#template) below
2. **Discuss** with team (PR or Slack)
3. **Update** based on feedback
4. **Commit** to git when team aligns
5. **Reference** in relevant code and docs

## Decision Tree

```
Should we document this decision?
    ↓
Is it a major architectural choice?
    ├─ YES → Create ADR-NNN.md
    └─ NO  → Document in code comments

Will this affect multiple teams long-term?
    ├─ YES → Create ADR-NNN.md
    └─ NO  → Document in relevant guide

Is there uncertainty or tradeoffs?
    ├─ YES → Create ADR-NNN.md (even if not major)
    └─ NO  → Just implement and reference in comments
```

## FAQs

**Q: Can we change an ADR after accepting it?**

A: No. If circumstances change significantly, create a new ADR (ADR-0011) that supersedes or
enhances the previous decision. Update the old ADR status to "Deprecated" or "Evolved To ADR-0011".

---

**Q: What if I disagree with an ADR?**

A: Respectfully discuss in:

1. Team meeting or Slack
2. Open a GitHub Discussion with your alternative
3. If consensus shifts, create a new ADR

Decisions are made by team consensus, not individuals.

---

**Q: How long should an ADR be?**

A: Typically 1-3 pages. If it's getting longer, consider breaking into multiple ADRs.

---

**Q: Who reviews ADRs?**

A: Team consensus. Typically:

- Security team (for security-related ADRs)
- DevOps team (for infrastructure ADRs)
- All developers (for architectural ADRs)

## Glossary

- **Status**: Proposed (draft), Accepted (approved), Deprecated (old, superseded)
- **Context**: The problem or decision driver
- **Rationale**: Why we chose this (supporting logic)
- **Consequences**: What happens because of this decision (good and bad)
- **Alternative**: Another viable approach we rejected

## Roadmap

**Planned ADRs (Q3-Q4 2026)**:

- [ ] **ADR-0019**: TBD (próximo: multi-repo orchestration o adapters de publicación por plataforma)
